<h4>Hello, welcome to my projects portfolio. I'll be actively adding to and updating this area with any personal projects or programs I have made within my University studies which I feel display my ability as a programmer :)</h4>

Currently available:</n>

**Java -  Reverse Lexicographical List Ordering.java**  
This project takes any length array of strings and returns them sorted in reverse alphabetical order.

**Python - spamclassifier/spamclassifier.ipynb**  
Spam refers to unwanted email, often in the form of advertisements. In this project, I wrote a supervised learning based classifier with a naive bayes algorithm to probabilistically determine whether any given email is spam or ham. Since this was a piece of University coursework, my code can be found on the jupyter notebook document following the above path.
